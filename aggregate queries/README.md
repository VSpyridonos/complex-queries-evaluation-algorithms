sorting2.1.py and hashing2.1.py print results after reading all data.

program2.2.py reads the dataset files, computes and prints results at the same time without loading all data in memory. This means that results are produced while the file lines are being read and before all data is read. This is possible because the dataset files have been sorted by the field tconst.
